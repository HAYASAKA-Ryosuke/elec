# Intent Review Checklist

1. Are app purpose and telemetry destination explicit?
2. Is sampling interval realistic for target device power/perf?
3. Do rule predicates map to available sensor signals?
4. Do actions map to available actuators in circuit.scm?
5. Are safety defaults conservative when details are missing?
6. Are all assumptions listed?
